If no folder in data was created or data moved there and no new option was added to the agent settings, it will work\r\n\r\nAfter restarting Plex servers, the new agent will be loaded and you will find all agents settings in the official framework agent settings window:\r\n   . \"Plex > Settings > Server > Agents > TV Shows > HamaTV > Agent settings\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:\r\n================\r\n\r\nCheck the data folders are created and the agent is where it should be, paste the agent logs relevant section\r\n\r\nPlex Logs:\r\n<UL>\r\n   <LI> Agent logs:        /volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Logs/PMS Plugin Logs/com.plexapp.agents.hama.log</LI>\r\n   <LI> Media Server logs: /volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Logs/Plex Media Server.log</LI>\r\n   <LI> Media Scannerlogs: /volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Logs/Plex Media Scanner.log</LI>\r\n</UL> \r\n\r\nHama specific html logs to allow to update databases for missing info or to list missing episodes\r\n<UL>\r\n   <LI> /volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Data/com.plexapp.agents.hama/DataItems/anime-list.htm</LI>\r\n   <LI> /volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Data/com.plexapp.agents.hama/DataItems/themes.htm</LI>\r\n   <LI> /volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Data/com.plexapp.agents.hama/DataItems/TVDB.htm</LI>\r\n   <LI> /volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Data/com.plexapp.agents.hama/DataItems/AniDB.htm</LI>\r\n   <LI> /volume1/Plex/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-in Support/Data/com.plexapp.agents.hama/DataItems/Missing Episodes.htm\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\nTo Do\r\n=====\r\n<UL>\r\n   <LI> Package of Studio Logos (see post https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/77636-release-http-anidb-metadata-agent-hama/?p=451061).

Plex use 30s songs but use seasons, so a package of songs capped at 30s should share the same legality. will not work on that but local loading works</LI>\r\n   <LI> Need to ammend the code so that not putting folders still download posters albeit without caching</LI>\r\n   <LI> Need to splig logs created so each contain one type of issue only (as overview missing in thetvdb flood poster missing messages for example)</LI>\r\n   <LI> Should i cache locally anidb XML? they are cached for 2 weeks so even if banned for a day, will allow to finish the next day...\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-51701691-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
